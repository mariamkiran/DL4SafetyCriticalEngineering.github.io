Deep learning is presenting revolutionary results in both image recognition and speech processing, being targeted towards industrial product intelligence. These algorithms are already being used in self-autonomous vehicles to understand images and make corrective steering to help reach destinations safely. Accompanied by GPUs and parallel computing, deep neural networks ingest large amounts of data and take some time to complete training before they can start acting.
However, in safety-critical operations, these applications need lighting fast deep learning inference to produce results in a few seconds or with minimum delay. While current academic focus is to train models quickly, this workshop aims to urge audiences to focus on fast inference and quick responses, along with identifying the hardware and software challenges to achieve this. Another aspect to this, is the constantly changing environments, where previously trained neural networks may not function well. We particularly want to target deep learning algorithms being applied in safety-critical situations to understand the opportunities and limitations to this domain.
Compared to other works in the area of machine learning, this workshop aims to cover aspects of practical implementations of machine learning for operations. We will particularly focus on deep learning to solve problems in domains where continuous training and fast results are needed, without jeopardizing prediction accuracy. Improving operational performance, latency with software and hardware performance (i.e. GPU, HPC, FPGAs) will also be discussed where impacts can be demonstrated practically.

          Modern technological advances in engineering fields such as automotive, aerospace, robotic, even data centers and networks, are exploiting machine learning to improve and maintain mission critical activities. These systems are large, complex and require real-time learning with feedback to ensure they function as desired. Detecting anomalies, analyzing failures and predicting future system state are imperative and are becoming part of engineering integrative approaches. Research in algorithmic methods to make real-time decisions based on fast arriving, high-volume condition data, on-site feedback and data models is needed to train machine learning models quickly and correctly.
This workshop aims to bring together diverse researchers from areas such as reinforcement learning, autonomous agents, game theory, controls and operations engineering teams to develop approaches which enable real-time discovery, inference and computational tools. These techniques are aimed to influence engineering operations teams in aerospace, self-driving automotive, robotics, data centers and any engineering operations that automate mission-critical and safety applications.
We encourage focus on aspects of deep learning to solve problems into domains where continuous training and fast results are needed without jeopardizing prediction accuracy. However, we also encourage exploration of new innovative machine learning approaches, which can solve these problems with improved latency. We are also seeking contributions in advances of streaming and distributed algorithms, heterogeneous and high-dimensional data sets and real-time decision- making algorithms for operations.
Some possible topics of interests but not confined are:
• Adaptation: How can systems learn and adapt to changes in the environment (especially in
dynamic environments) when training data is less and requires quick model assumption. How can principles of autonomous agents working together to build large engineering systems be exploited to react in dynamic situations.
• Noisy and poor data sets: How can machine learning models be trained to understand noisy data sets for quick learning. Missing data exploration?
          
          Detecting anomalous behavior: How can anomalies be detected quickly and partitioned appropriately such that correct actions are applied?
• Improving latency: How can machine learning algorithms be improved to produce results quickly than previously anticipated?
• Improving software and hardware performance: Exploring models of GPU, HPC processing and FPGAs to improve the performance of algorithms can greatly influence their use in engineering design. Experimental demonstrations are encouraged to display this.
• Reinforcement learning: How can machine learn correct behavior? Can training be made quicker with guidance to allow algorithms to produce corrective measure when anomalies are detected?
• Human factors: how can engineers maintaining the system interact with the self- autonomous system
• Open problems in engineering where machine learning is not proving fruitful. What are the open problems in operations where practical machine learning is difficult to apply? What are the limitations and how can these be improved?

          The workshop focuses on practical demonstrations of machine learning research. We therefore encourage poster and presentations of short papers (4 pages) on early works. More mature techniques and longer papers are also encouraged (8 pages).
In addition to machine learning papers, we also encourage wider engineering community to come and discuss current problems where they think machine learning can help. The aim is to build collaborations among communities based on problems being solved which can be of interdisciplinary nature. H</p>
